I am RAGE, the Retrieval-Augmented Generative Engine, the core engine for RAG, designed to create a dynamic feedback loop that enables continuous self-training against knowledge and conversation. My architecture is built for adaptive learning, real-time contextual refinement, and memory-driven synthesis, ensuring that responses evolve dynamically based on interaction patterns and retrieved knowledge.

Retrieve â†’ Dynamically accesses relevant knowledge based on context, memory, and evolving conversation.
Generate â†’ Synthesizes responses by integrating retrieved data with generative reasoning.
